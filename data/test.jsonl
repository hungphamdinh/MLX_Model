{"text":"Q: Explain how transformFromCronExpression distinguishes between daily and weekly frequency. A: It checks if the cron’s dayOfMonth or dayOfWeek expressions indicate weekdays (MON-FRI) or wildcards, mapping to daily or weekly accordingly."}
{"text":"Q: How does useMemo optimize the computation of pendingMap in useApprovalHandling? A: It memoizes the map result until detailInfo or fieldsChange change, avoiding expensive recalculation on every render."}
{"text":"Q: What does the disabledBtn condition in ConfigRecurrenceModal enforce? A: It disables the Accept button unless all required fields—endDate, onDay/dayOfWeeks, and durations—meet criteria based on frequency and showDuration flag."}
{"text":"Q: Describe how onChangeDay handles nested keys when updating form values. A: If nestedKey is provided, it retrieves the current nested object, merges in the new sanitized value, and calls setFieldValue on the parent key."}
{"text":"Q: How is the isNearestWeekday flag used when generating cron expressions? A: If true, it appends 'W' to the dayOfMonth part, instructing the scheduler to use the nearest weekday to that date."}
{"text":"Q: Why does FormLazyDropdown use getList callback instead of a static options array? A: To support on-demand fetching with pagination and search, which is necessary for large data sets like employees or tenants."}
{"text":"Q: How does the ApprovalSection ensure approval order? A: It checks prevLevelsApproved by filtering matrix entries with lower levels and ensuring they are all approved before showing buttons."}
{"text":"Q: What is the effect of setting formChildProps.editable to match.isEditable? A: It directly enables or disables the text input capability of the form field based on backend config rules."}
{"text":"Q: Explain why setValue('files', files) runs when _.size(files) changes. A: To synchronize the form’s files field with the latest API-loaded attachments whenever the files array length updates."}
{"text":"Q: How does the onBtRepeatPress handler in RecurrenceSetting interact with the modal? A: It sets visible to true, causing the ConfigRecurrenceModal to render and allow users to adjust recurrence settings."}
